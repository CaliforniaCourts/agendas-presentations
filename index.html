                        I really enjoyed being able to meet developers from other counties, along with having the opportunity to see what other devs
                        were working on! The swag was pretty awesome too...

                        I'd be interested in a project relevant tools approach: such as how are the courts coding their other projects, websites,...:
                        aspx, bootstrap, jquery, ... is there a possibility of developing a common .css for that? Could CourtDev
                        have a github shared resource site, for common projects

                    <blockquote>
                        A deeper dive into fewer topics. Presentations were great for broad exposure but felt lacking in details. Possibly some discussion
                        on architecture and best practices.
